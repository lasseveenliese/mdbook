Polygons can be modified after a field recording by an eligible user (it is possible to forbid this to stop unwanted modification after a recording). There are numerous reasons why someone might want to modify the outline of a boundary:

* Maybe two adjacent polygons have a slight overlap
* An area that should not be included (grassland, road, lake, ...) was included by accident during the field recording
* A section of a site was inaccessible due to fire, flood, vegetation or steep terrain.

To edit the shape of the polygon select Edit and move the vertices (red circles) around. You can add or delete points by clicking on the small yellow points in between vertices. To delete a vertice, select it and click on the trash icon.

To keep track of which data has been recorded in the field and which modifications have been made to a polygon after the recording process, we have introduced a history funtionality which indicates where the original outline of a polygon was.
