# greenhouse. A powerful tool for Landscape Restoration.

Having used various tools to view tens of thousands of GPS-Photos as datapoints (e.g. Google Earth Pro, our custom map ( https://maps.wellsforzoe.org/?zoom=7&lat=-13.3&lng=34 ) the process of importing data in near real-time was always frustrating and cumbersome. If you capture and upload a GPS-Photo with Flority App it instantly shows up in the Gallery as well as a dot on the map.
Thousands of users can now capture field data to contribute to increase the transparency of Landscape Restoration Projects based on Natural Solutions.

It is accessible using the same Login Information as with Flority App so each user has full control and insight into their captured data. It is not optimized for phone so when using on a phone it is highly recommended to enable Desktop Mode. There will be some improvements over time but it is intended to be used on Desktop as of now.
