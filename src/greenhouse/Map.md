The map module is designed for the bulk visualization of tens of thousands of datapoints. There are two main different options to display data:

* Heatmap: the more intense the colour, the more datapoints are in the respective area.

* Cluster: more contemporary view but less intuitive

Blue dots represent the position where a GPS-Photo has been taken. To be able to quickly assess which kind of activity is represented, the thumbnails at the bottom are a random subsection of images.

If you hover over an image a larger dot indicates in which area of the map the image is located.

You can click on a thumbnail to view a larger image as well as additional metadata. This is the case for GPS-Photos, as well as for GPS-Polygons.
