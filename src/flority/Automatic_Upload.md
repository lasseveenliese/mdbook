Should network fail then it will automatically retry.

Deactivating the Automatic Upload however bears the risk that inexperienced users simply forget to submit photos over a long period of time. 

However it allows (optional setting) to access the internal Flority Gallery Functionality where photos can be reviewed, deleted, tags be edited and forms answered.
Any data captured will accumulate on your phone and not be deleted from the internal Flority storage, so if you were to never upload photos but keep capturing photos your storage might eventually run low.
