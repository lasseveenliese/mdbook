## Forms
A form is usually co-designed by the Superior Project Developer and highly standardized to fit the criteria the project documentation protocol requires. Forms can include additional Options to add GPS-Photos (e.g. for Accounting Documentation it is possible and actually feasible to use Flority) as well as any sort of usual Form Options be it Multiple Choice, Numbers or written answers. Following are some examples to give a rough overview of possibilities. 


* Simple comment
* Select a date and/or time
* Add additional GPS-Photos within the form
* Note measurements (e.g. tree diameter DBH)
* Species names and numbers planted
* Socioeconomic survey data
