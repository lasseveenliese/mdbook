It can be helpful to be able to associate field data with different projects, especially if an organization has multiple projects (e.g. in different countries or from different donors) or a user is eligible to record field data from multiple projects (e.g. a 3rd party site inspector) then it is possible to activate the Project Selector Option within Flority. 
* If you do not see a Project Selector Option then you are not eligible to use this functionality.
* If you do see the Project Selector, then you should always select the appropriate project the respective field data should be associated with.


In the example of the TerraFund for AFR100 projects this option could be valuable for large Organizations with projects in two different countries but more importantly if WRI or 3rd party field staff would do field visits at multiple different projects by different organizations.
