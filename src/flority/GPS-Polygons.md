# GPS-Polygons
## Classic Mode
GPS-Polygons are recorded by walking around the area of interest (e.g. restoration site) and taking GPS-Photos, ideally looking inwards, at bends to demarcate the area. Depending on boundary-complexity of the site, less or more photos are sufficient during this process (see example)

As the App can not know when Polygonrecording is finished, the very last step is to select the #polygon-end Option and capture one final photo.

This triggers to open a form to add additional attributes, in the custom Form for TerraFund for AFR100, the following additional attributes can be added with some marked mandatory.

### Info:
If one should have to pause recording due to unforeseen weather events or low battery it is possible to revisit the site within 48 hours and continue the polygon recording and finish it with #polgyon-end as if there had not been a break in between.  
Should the surveyor forget to finish the polygonrecording with a final photo with #polygon-end the system will try to autoclose the polygon and send an alert to the surveyor (if an Email is registered with the user) as well as with their respective Project Administrator.
