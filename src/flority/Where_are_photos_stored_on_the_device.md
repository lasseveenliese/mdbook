## Photo storage
Flority App creates two identical copies of each photo captured: One copy is stored in your regular phone gallery and you have full access to it, the other copy is hidden for the user in an inaccessible location and can not be manually deleted. This is necessary to ensure that submitted photos are always original and unaltered.
