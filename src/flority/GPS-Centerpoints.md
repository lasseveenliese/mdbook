## GPS-Centerpoints for TerraFund for AFR100 Monitoring

GPS-Centerpoints can be used to mark the center of a Dispersed Landscape Restoration Plot, e.g. if a farmer plants trees on less than 3ha one would go to the center of his activities, usually his farm and mark that area with a GPS-centerpoint. To do this, select the GPS-Centerpoint option, decide if this is the right option after reading the info popup, then capture a GPS-Photo and fill out the attached form with the additioNally requested attributes and click on Upload.
