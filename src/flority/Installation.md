## Updating the App
To ensure a smooth App update procedure usually a warning will show that in e.g. 7 days an update will be required to keep uploading data to greenhouse. 


Should one not be able to update the App (e.g. when offline in the field), then it will still be possible to capture photos and data in the field but upload will be deactivated and this warning message will appear:

Once back in an area with network please simply install the new version without removing the current version. All your data will not be lost during this process and after updating you will be able to upload previously captured data to greenhouse. 

## Compatibility
Flority App currently is only compatible with Android devices
