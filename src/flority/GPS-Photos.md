## GPS-Photos

GPS-Photos are photos with a geolocation tag. While many camera apps can record a geolocation tag, Flority will only allow the user to capture a geotagged photo within a certain accuracy threshold, e.g. 10m.

The camera will be deactivated to avoid having GPS-Photos showing up at the wrong location with  an error of hundreds of meters if not kilometers which is actually one of the reasons the App was invented.

## Documenting work in a daily photostream

Flority can be used to document daily work in a nursery, at site preparation as well as documenting any planting acitivities and #tags can be set in camera during the capture of a photo so that different activities can be easily categorized and separated on the map in greenhouse. 

Being able to gather hundreds of photos dispersed throughout a landscape gives a clear indication where work is happening and it can improve the project significantly if images are analyzed by experienced ecologists.

If one has individual geotagged sample images of trees planted it can help to determine how accurately GPS-Polygons are delinated or if accidentally an area has been missed or left out by accident. Knowing where Landscape Restoration work is happening is of course the first step in a tedious analysis of the impact on landscape and community.
Following is an example where one can see an area being left out in the polygon allowing a drone map to be expanded above this area, field staff to be sent back to re-record the polygon.

Another example perfectly illustrates the usefulness of the high accuracy of the geotagged GPS-Photos:
Trees have been planted along a road in an alley style. One blue dot indicating the positions of the GPS-Photos however is directly next to a building... hovering over the images at the bottom it can be seen that it is a preschool and therefore all photos are within reasonable accuracy limits to become useful datapoints.
