## Geospatial Accuracy
If your device does not yet have the required geopositional accuracy (which is defined by the Project or Organization Administrator) a warning message will appear. Should this message show up in the field for several minutes repeatedly please reach out to your project administrator and let us know which device and user name you are using as we could then decrease the accuracy threshold required. 
Android offers a minimum setting of 5m.
